        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Architecture

The project follows clean architecture principles:

### Core Components

- **Models/**: JSON-RPC and MCP data models
- **Services/**: Core business logic
  - `GitService`: Handles git operations, remote branches, and documentation generation
  - `McpServer`: Implements the MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
- **Program.cs**: Application entry point with dependency injection

### Key Features

- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all git operations
- **Remote Branch Support**: Full support for remote repository operations
- **Flexible Output**: Multiple output formats (Markdown, HTML, Text)
- **Configurable**: Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults
- **Logging**: File-based logging to avoid JSON-RPC interference

## Dependencies

- **LibGit2Sharp**: For comprehensive git operations including remote branches
- **Microsoft.Extensions.\*\*\***: For logging, configuration, and dependency injection
- **System.Text.Json**: For JSON serialization with optimal performance
- **Serilog.Extensions.Logging.File**: For file-based logging with rotation

## Development

### Logging Strategy

The application uses Serilog with file output to avoid interfering with JSON-RPC communication:

- **Production**: Logs written to `logs/gitvisionmcp.log` at Information level
- **Development**: Logs written to `logs/gitvisionmcp-dev.log` at Debug level
- **Log Rotation**: Daily log files with 7-day retention
- **Output Isolation**: No console logging to ensure clean JSON-RPC communication

### Error Handling

All tools include comprehensive error handling:

- Git operation failures (repository not found, invalid refs, etc.)
- Remote access issues (network problems, authentication)
- File system errors (permissions, disk space)
- Invalid parameters and edge cases

### Testing

Test the server manually:

```powershell
# Set production environment
$env:DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT="Production"

# Test basic communication
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}' | dotnet run --no-build --verbosity quiet

# Test tools list
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | dotnet run --no-build --verbosity quiet
```

- **Production**: Logs written to `logs/gitvisionmcp.log` at Information level
- **Development**: Logs written to `logs/gitvisionmcp-dev.log` at Debug level
- **Log Configuration**: Configurable via `appsettings.json` and environment-specific files
- **Log Rotation**: Daily log files with automatic cleanup (via Serilog.Extensions.Logging.File)

The logs directory is automatically created and ignored by git (.gitignore).

- Production: Information level
- Development: Debug/Trace level

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Failed to parse message" warnings

If you see warnings like:

```
[warning] Failed to parse message: "Using launch settings from..."
[warning] Failed to parse message: "Building..."
[warning] Failed to parse message: "info: Program[0]"
```

**Solution**: Build messages or logging output is interfering with JSON-RPC communication.

1. **Build the project first**:

   ```powershell
   dotnet build --configuration Release
   ```

2. **Use the correct MCP configuration** (production settings):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "GitVisionMCP": {
         "command": "dotnet",
         "args": [
           "run",
           "--project",
           "c:\\path\\to\\GitVisionMCP.csproj",
           "--no-build",
           "--verbosity",
           "quiet"
         ],
         "env": {
           "DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT": "Production"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Verify clean output**:
   ```powershell
   $env:DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT="Production"
   echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}' | dotnet run --no-build --verbosity quiet
   ```
   You should see only JSON output, no log messages.

#### Remote branch access issues

**Error**: "Remote branch not found" or "Authentication failed"

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify remote access**:

   ```powershell
   git remote -v
   git ls-remote origin
   ```

2. **Fetch latest remote references**:

   ```powershell
   git fetch --all
   ```

3. **Check authentication** (for private repositories):
   - Ensure SSH keys are configured
   - Or use personal access tokens for HTTPS

#### Invalid branch or commit references

**Error**: "Branch not found" or "Invalid commit hash"

**Solutions**:

1. **List available branches**:
   Use the `get_all_branches` tool to see available branches

2. **Verify commit hashes**:

   ```powershell
   git log --oneline -10
   ```

3. **Use correct branch names**:
   - Local: `main`, `feature/api`
   - Remote: `origin/main`, `upstream/dev`

#### Performance issues with large repositories

**Issue**: Slow responses or timeouts

**Solutions**:

1. **Limit commit count**: Use smaller `maxCommits` values (10-50)
2. **Use specific file filters**: When getting diffs, specify `specificFiles`
3. **Fetch selectively**: Use specific remote names instead of fetching all

#### Permission issues

**Error**: "Access denied" or "Permission denied"

**Solutions**:

1. **Check file permissions**: Ensure write access to output directory
2. **Run as administrator**: If needed for system directories
3. **Use relative paths**: Avoid system directories, use workspace-relative paths

### Performance Tips

1. **Start with smaller datasets**: Use lower `maxCommits` values initially
2. **Use caching**: The server caches git operations within a session
3. **Fetch strategically**: Only fetch when comparing with remote branches
4. **Monitor logs**: Check log files for performance insights

### Debug Mode

For detailed debugging, use development environment:

```powershell
$env:DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT="Development"
dotnet run
```

This enables detailed logging to `logs/gitvisionmcp-dev.log`.

## Best Practices

### Branch Naming

- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/user-auth`, `bugfix/login-error`
- Follow team conventions for remote references

### Output Organization

- Create dedicated documentation folders: `docs/`, `analysis/`
- Use timestamp prefixes for historical comparisons: `2024-01-15-release-analysis.md`

### Remote Repository Management

- Regularly fetch remote changes: `fetch_from_remote`
- Keep local branches synchronized with remote counterparts
- Use meaningful remote names: `origin`, `upstream`, `fork`
